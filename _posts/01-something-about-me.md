title: Something about me
---

Hello! I am a student of class 11, Kollam, Kerala, India. I'm in love with Science, Books and progrmming. I grew interested in HTML when my friend, when in 6th, asked a question on the topic to me. I was determined to find the answer, which I found eventually, and made me fall in love with web design and development using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. I also know a little bit of PHP. 

I studied web development from [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) and continued to study development from [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com), [Udacity](http://udacity.com), among others.
