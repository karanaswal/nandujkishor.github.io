title: Working on Jekyll project for GCI on a task by Fossasia
---

This seems to be my first experiment using Ruby for web development. Well, not coding with it, but playing with a tool built in Ruby. I heard on Jekyll in 2014, as something similar to Wordpress that generates static pages, a idea I've used in my websites, and required no databases.

I thank [Fossasia](http://fossasia.org/) for making me play with it in Github, a combination I've never tried before.

I tried creating it on the cloud, but it seemed my computer needed to be equipped with all those tools. I installed Ruby, Bundler and Jekyll. And, now, I think I'm satisfied. I've used the help of many articles in doing the work, and I thank all those who wrote them. And, [Fossasia](http://fossasia.org/) has done a great job creating such a task for the GCI.
