title: Something about me
---

Hello! I am a student of class 11, Kollam, Kerala, India. I'm in love with Science, Books and programming. I grew interested in HTML when my friend, when in 6th, asked a question on the topic to me. I was determined to find the answer, which I found eventually, and made me fall in love with web design and development using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. I also know a little bit of PHP. 

I studied web development from [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) and continued to study development from [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com), [Udacity](http://udacity.com), among others.

Besides these, I just love reading and writing on Science. Do visit [Think NCSC](http://thinkncsc.com), a science website I've developed. Science has always been a good companion to me. I do love watching TED talks. Did I say I reading magazine articles too? I love magazines, both offline and online, and subscribe to National Geographic Magazine India, BBC Knowledge India, Readers Digest and Forbes India. Don't laugh, but I want to start a Science magazine next year.

Currently, I'm after learning Machine Learning. Even though a tough subject, and uncertain whether I could study it well, I've been continuing since I'm really in love with it. When I grow up, I want to be a member of the AI team at Google, even though it is a little too big ambition.
